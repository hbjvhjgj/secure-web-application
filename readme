This project is a secure web application that demonstrates key cybersecurity concepts including authentication, encryption, input validation, session management, and secure error handling.
It is built using Python for backend logic and Streamlit for the frontend interface.

The app allows users to register, log in, encrypt/decrypt data, and update profiles, while showcasing proper security measures and manual testing of 20 different vulnerabilities and use cases.

⚙️ Features Implemented
Feature	Description	Purpose
User Registration & Login	Stores usernames and hashed passwords using bcrypt	Authentication & password security
Password Validation	Enforces strong passwords (min length, digits, symbols)	Password strength testing
Input Validation	Prevents SQL/script injection and checks for valid formats	Injection and validation testing
Session Management	Manages user sessions and prevents unauthorized access	Unauthorized access testing
Data Storage Layer	Stores sensitive data securely (hashed/encrypted)	Data confidentiality
Error Handling	Prevents sensitive info leakage in error messages	Information leakage testing
Encryption / Decryption	Allows users to encrypt and decrypt data	Data protection testing
Audit / Activity Logs	Records all user actions securely	Integrity and traceability
Profile Update Page	Allows safe editing of user details	Access control testing
File Upload Validation (Optional)	Restricts upload types (e.g., .txt, .jpg)	File-based attack testing
