# Secure Cybersecurity Demo App

## Overview
This is a small secure web application built with **Streamlit** to demonstrate key cybersecurity concepts, including:

- User authentication with **SHA-256 hashed passwords**
- Strong password validation
- Email validation
- Session management and logout
- Data protection using **encryption/decryption**
- Audit logging of user actions
- Error handling to prevent sensitive information leakage

The app allows users to **register, login, update profiles, encrypt/decrypt data**, and test common security scenarios manually.
